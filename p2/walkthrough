we have a total of 3 networks. 
- A network with the switch and the 2 routers
- One network by hosts

-> The goal to this exercice is to connect the 2 hosts on the same network 30.1.1.x/24 with a vxlan and a bridge
(Without vxlan it should'nt be able to connect them on the same network, because they are on differents networks)

Routers are connected via a same switch, so to connect them with a layer 3 (IP) we assign them an ip address 

We define the routers network (10.1.1.x)
- router-1: ip link addr add 10.1.1.1 de eth0
- router-2: ip link addr add 10.1.1.2 de eth0

We create and configure a Bridge link
-> ip link add br0 type bridge
-> ip link set br0 up

Then we create a Vxlan link:
- ip link add vxlan10 type vxlan id 10 dev eth0 remote 30.1.1.x local 30.1.1.y 
- ip link set vxlan10 up

To display the configuration of the interface you can use this command: ip -d link sho vxlan10

We link the 2 interfaces with the bridge 

- vxlan10 
	brctl addif br0 vxlan10
- eth1 (interface connected to the host)
	brctl addif br0 eth1

The vxlan is in unicast mode, we specified the options 'remote' and 'local' hosts (VTEP)
To set the vxlan in multicast we need to replace the 'remote IP' and 'local IP' by 'group IP' wich assign VTEP an id of all hosts
